# MMT Plugin for Visual Studio Code

Highly experimental VSCode Plugin for the MMT language, using the just as experimental MMT LSP Server. Both this client as well as the server are developed in parallel.

The LSP Server is documented [here](https://github.com/UniFormal/MMT/tree/devel/src/mmt-lsp).

The implementation of semantic highlighting (see link above) is adapted from [this implementation](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia/pull/2332/commits/f25a62215d119acdf66ac62fd73eac4333bc09ee).
